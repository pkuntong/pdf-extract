Accountants and bookkeepers waste 10+ hours per week manually entering invoice data.

I know because I used to do it myself. Copy invoice number, paste. Copy vendor name, paste. Copy total, paste...

There had to be a better way.

Title: "Just launched my SaaS after 6 months of development - PDF data extraction tool"

Hey fellow entrepreneurs!

Today I launched PDF Extract Pro, a tool that uses AI to extract invoice data from PDFs automatically.

**The backstory:**
As a former accountant, I spent countless hours manually copying invoice data into spreadsheets. I knew there had to be a better way, so I spent the last 6 months building it.

**What it does:**
• Extracts invoice numbers, vendors, totals, line items
• Works on mobile and desktop
• Processes files offline for privacy
• Exports to CSV for easy import

**The launch:**
• Built with Next.js, Supabase, and AI APIs
• Free tier: 5 extractions/month
• Pro tier: $9.99/month for 100 extractions
• Live on Product Hunt today

**Lessons learned:**
1. Talk to users BEFORE building (I interviewed 50+ accountants)
2. Start with a simple MVP (took 6 weeks for V1)
3. Launch early and iterate based on feedback

Would love feedback from this community. Happy to answer any questions about the technical stack or business model!

```
Title: "Tool for automating invoice data entry - made by a former accountant"

Hey r/accounting!

Former Big 4 here who got tired of manual invoice processing, so I built an AI tool to automate it.

**What it does:**
Uploads a PDF invoice, extracts all the key data (vendor, invoice #, line items, totals) in seconds.

**Why I built it:**
We all know the pain of copy/paste/repeat for hours. This eliminates that entirely.

**Features accountants asked for:**
• Bulk processing for month-end
• CSV export for easy import
• Mobile upload (process invoices anywhere)
• Offline processing (client confidentiality)

Offering it free for small firms (5 extractions/month). Would love feedback from the community that knows this pain best.

Not trying to sell anything - genuinely want to make our profession less tedious!
